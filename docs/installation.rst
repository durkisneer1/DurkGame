Installation
============

.. note::
    Kraken Engine is still in development and is not ready for production use.
    This means that there aren't any pre-built binaries for Kraken Engine yet, so you have to build it yourself.

Before starting, ensure you have meson installed, as well as the four core SDL2 frameworks installed in any package manager.

1. Clone the Kraken Engine `repository <https://github.com/durkisneer1/Kraken-Engine>`_.
2. Run the ``setup.py`` script to install dependencies and compile the lib and example program.
3. Once complete, you will find the compiled files in the ``builddir`` folder.

.. note::
	If you run into problems building the project, please open an issue.
