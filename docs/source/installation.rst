Kraken Engine as of now has only been tested and confirmed to work on the following systems:

* Windows 10/11
* Several Linux distributions

.. note::
    Kraken Engine is still in development and is not ready for production use.
    This means that there aren't any pre-built binaries for Kraken Engine yet, so you have to build it yourself.

Instructions on building Kraken Engine are coming soon.
